# 🧬 Purpose
**A suite of tools for unlocking Jira data to uncover powerful Agile delivery insights.**

## 🔭 Current focus
**Generating enterprise-to-portfolio metrics from inaccessible Jira data. These metrics are then used to analyze and report spillover (uncompleted planned work), driving significant improvements in planned predictability.**

## 🚧 Projects
- **[jira-spillover-get](https://github.com/ExponentiallyDigital/jira-spillover-get)** – extracts incomplete sprint work
- **[jira-spillover-chart](https://github.com/ExponentiallyDigital/jira-spillover-chart)** – visualises delivery patterns
- **jira-spillover-stat** *(in dev)* – computes spillover metrics and anomalies

## 🛠️ Stack
Golang · Python · PowerShell

## 🌱 Learning
Ongoing research into proprietary Jira API access methods and advanced project data analysis techniques.

## 🎨 Side Hustle
Widows Performance tuning and debugging.
Image sorting by human perception of colour and light using perceptual spaces (HSL, CIELAB, CIECAM02) and tools like PIL, OpenCV, scikit-image, colorspacious, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
