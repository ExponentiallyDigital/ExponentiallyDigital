# 🧬 Purpose
**Primarily tools for unlocking Jira data to uncover Agile delivery insights**

## 🔭 Current focus

- **[jira-spillover-chart](https://github.com/ExponentiallyDigital/jira-spillover-chart)** – visualises delivery patterns
- **jira-spillover-stat** *(in dev)* – computes spillover metrics and anomalies
