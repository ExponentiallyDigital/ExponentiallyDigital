# 🧠 Purpose

**Unlocking Jira operational data to surface new insights into Agile delivery.**

## 🔭 Current focus
Identifying sprint spillover (planned work that didn’t complete in the assigned sprint) and surfacing learnings to improve future delivery.

## 🚧 Active projects
- **[jira-spillover-get](https://github.com/ExponentiallyDigital/jira-spillover-get)** *(released)*  
  Identify and report on Jira "spillover": work items that weren't completed within their originally planned sprint. This tools helps teams track delivery efficiency and improve planning.

- **[jira-spillover-chart](https://github.com/ExponentiallyDigital/jira-spillover-chart)** *(released)*  
  Converts TSV files from jira-spillover-get into rich visualisation and reporting to highlight delivery patterns.

- **jira-spillover-stat** *(in development)*  
  Computes rich spillover metrics and anomaly detection for team retrospectives, including aggregate team analysis for cross-project pattern identification.

## 🌌 Guiding principle
Software isn't limited by our senses, only by our imagination.

## 🎨 Side hustle
Exploring image analysis and sorting based on human perceptions of colour and light. Including

- investigating perceptual colour spaces to better reflect how humans distinguish hue, saturation, and brightness
- building tooling to cluster and rank images by visual impact, contrast, and ambient tone

with

- PIL, scikit-image, sklearn's KMeans (artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning (ML) and statistical modelling with scikit-learn), OpenCV, CV2, colorspacious, TensorFlow PyTorch, in HSL, CIECAM02, and CIELAB.

This bridges technical precision with aesthetic intuition—where algorithms meet human perception.
